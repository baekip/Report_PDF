 At this site, the called genotype is?GT = 0/1, which is C/T. The confidence indicated by?GQ = 25.92?isn't so good, largely because there were only a total of 4 reads at this site (DP =4), 1 of which was REF (=had the reference base) and 3 of which were ALT (=had the alternate base) (indicated by?AD=1,3). 
The lack of certainty is evident in the PL field, where?PL(0/1) = 0?(the normalized value that corresponds to a likelihood of 1.0). There's a chance that the subject is "homozygous variant allele"  since?PL(1/1) = 26, which corresponds to 10^(-2.6), or 0.0025, but either way, it's clear that the subject is definitely?not?"homozygous reference allele"  since?PL(0/0) = 103, which corresponds to 10^(-10.3), a very small number. It could say that the higher the value of PL, the lower probability to be the another GTs, in here homozygous variant allele or homozygous reference allele . 

	   - GQ tells how confident GATK is that the genotype it assigned to a particular sample is correct.
	   - QUAL tells how confident that there is some kind of variations at a given site and the variation may be present in one or more samples. QUAL (or more importantly, its normalized form, QD) is mostly useful in multi-sample context since it shows the evidence of variation overall. 

 If there is only one sample, especially if it has a good GQ ( and well separated PLs), QUAL may seem redundant; one knows what one have. If the GQ is not good, one can typically rely on the PLs to tell one whether one do probably have a variant; GATK is just not sure the variant is heterozygous or homozygous variant. If  homozygous reference allele is also a probability, the call may be a potential false positive.
