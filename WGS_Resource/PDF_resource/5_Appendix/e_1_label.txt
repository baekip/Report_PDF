3. Phred Quality Score
	 

	 Phred quality scores Q are defined as a property which is logarithmically related to the base-calling error probabilities P.


        	                                   ¡Ü Q = -10 log10 P


	 If Phred assigns a quality score of 30 to a base, the chances that this base is called incorrectly are 1 in 1000. The high accuracy of Phred scores make them an ideal tool to assess the quality of sequences.
