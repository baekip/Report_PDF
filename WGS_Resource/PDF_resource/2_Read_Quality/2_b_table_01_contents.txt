¡Ü Total reads: The total number of reads generated.
¡Ü The number of reads after trimming with Sickle; (%) = No. of clean reads / No. of Total reads.
¡Ü Total bases: The total bases of total reads; Total reads * length of reads.
¡Ü Total bases of clean reads; (%) = No. of clean bases/No. of Total bases.
¡Ü The number of reads mapped to the reference using BWA mapping tool; (%) = No. of mapped reads / No. of clean reads. 
¡Ü Average Depth: Mean coverage of all baits in the experiment
