¡Ü The mapping process is to compare the sequenced reads to a customer-designated reference gonome using string alignment algorithm.
¡Ü We extract unique alignment, between each read and the reference genome after de-duplication.
¡Ü Sample ID: ID provided from customer
¡Ü Sequence read: Number of reads in raw sequence
¡Ü Deduplication read: Number of reads after de-duplication
¡Ü Mapping read: Number of mapped reads 
¡Ü On-target read: Number of mapped reads to targeted regions on the genome
